        <p class="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite
          are open source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid product. Another difference is that
          Flowbite relies on smaller and standalone components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite
          Pro, and even Tailwind UI as there is no technical reason stopping you from using the best of two worlds.</p>
